# Arduino based AGV (Bachelor's Thesis 2017)
*Written for "Chalmers Bachelor's Thesis 2017"* 

Each folder holds the necessary aruduino code for respective component. 
The combined code used in the actual prototype is in the main folder.

# TODO:
Inplement and test the dStep function during docking. Separate the main code into lesser files. Improvements could be made to the searching algorithm to compensate for missing signals in middle of a span. A compensation could be made with trigonometry so that the AGV moves to the middle of the docking path instead of walking straight towoards the signal.
